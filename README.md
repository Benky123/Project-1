## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Per capita ethanol consumption for states in the US data from 1977 to 2016 to better understand:

1. Which states have the highest alcohol consumption per capita between 2014 and 2016 (e.g., Beer;  Wine; Spirits; and all beverages)?
2. Which state has the highest Beer comsumption growth from 2014 to 20216?
3. Which state has the highest Wine comsumption growth from 2014 to 20216?
4. Which state has the highest Spirits comsumption growth from 2014 to 20216?
5. What is the relationship amount beer, wine,  and spirts comsumption?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions above.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linzey/alcohol-consumption-us).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
